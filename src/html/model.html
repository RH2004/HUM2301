      <h1>The 3D Model — Design & Materials</h1>
      <p class="lede">Our physical model is divided into three sections: the House, the Road, and the Cemetery. Each section symbolizes a key moment in the Prophet’s journey through grief and faith during the Year of Sorrow.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. The House — Light and Intimacy</h2>
        <p>
          The house represents the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) home with Khadija (RA). It is built as a small enclosure with a soft inner light, symbolizing warmth, love, and peace. 
          The LED bulb inside glows gently to signify the comfort of companionship and the foundation of emotional and spiritual support that Khadija provided. 
          The moment the light dims captures the Prophet’s immense loss after her passing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. The Road — Journey and Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The road connects the house and the cemetery. Its sand texture and faint footprints evoke the long, silent walks the Prophet (PBUH) would take in contemplation and remembrance. 
          It serves as a physical and spiritual bridge between the world of companionship and solitude, reflecting the Prophet’s perseverance and connection with God amid hardship.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. The Cemetery — Loss and Serenity</h2>
        <p>
          The cemetery symbolizes the final resting place of Khadija (RA). It is designed with simple clay and stone graves, emphasizing humility and peace. 
          A single symbolic marker stands without inscription, representing both respect and restraint. The muted tones and calm arrangement convey acceptance and the enduring bond of love and faith.
        </p>
      </section>
