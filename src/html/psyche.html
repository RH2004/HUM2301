      <h1>Faith, Love, and Grief — A Deep Psychological Reflection</h1>
      <p class="lede">Khadija's death is one of the most human moments in the Prophet Muhammad’s life. Below is an expanded psychological analysis grounded in classical Islamic understanding and modern grief theory.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>1. Attachment, security and loss</h2>
        <p>
          Khadija (RA) provided a secure emotional and social base for the Prophet. In attachment terms, this secure base enabled him to function under intense stress and adversity.
          The sudden removal of that base is analogous to the rupture experienced in bereavement that shakes identity, routine and perceived support. Contemporary grief models underscore how the loss of a primary attachment figure affects cognitive schemas, sleep & appetite, and the ability to maintain focus.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Complex grief in the Year of Sorrow</h2>
        <p>
          The Prophet's sorrow was intensified because it followed other social losses (notably Abu Talib). Psychological literature shows that multiple bereavements in short succession increase the risk of prolonged or complicated grief reactions — yet they also force meaning-making processes to act rapidly.
          Historical sources show that the Prophet experienced withdrawal, intense private mourning, and changes in social interaction — behavioural markers consistent with the early phases of grief.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Emotional expression and normative faith frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          Islamic tradition permits sincere emotional expression within the boundaries of faith and dignity. The Prophet’s tears and his acts of remembrance provide a theology of mourning: authentic emotion plus submission to Divine decree.
          This combination — authentic emotional processing plus spiritual resources (prayer, ritual, remembrance) — resembles modern integrative grief therapy approaches where meaning-making (spiritual or secular) is a primary mechanism of recovery.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Meaning-making and post-loss growth</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most resilient responses to loss is the ability to integrate the event into a coherent life story. Khadija’s influence became part of the Prophet’s mission: her support shaped his public role and remained in his actions and memory.
          Clinically, survivors who find meaning or vocation in loss report better long-term outcomes: purpose anchors memory into legacy rather than chronic absence.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Ritual, memory & memorialisation</h2>
        <p>
          The model’s cemetery and acts of remembrance (prayer, charitable action) mirror therapeutic practices of memorialisation.
          Rituals — even quiet, private ones — stabilise grief by providing repeated, meaningful acts that reconfigure the relationship with the deceased from physical presence to social memory.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Practical implications for the model & presentation</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>House (light on):</strong> secure attachment and mutual life. Use warm gold lighting, texture, and small objects to evoke life.</li>
          <li><strong>Road (transition):</strong> scattering of light or footprint impressions — the liminal zone between attachment and acceptance.</li>
          <li><strong>Cemetery (memory):</strong> simple stones and quiet space — a place for communal memory and reflection.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
